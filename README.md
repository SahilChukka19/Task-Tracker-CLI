# Task Tracker CLI App

This project is a simple command-line application for managing a to-do list. It allows you to add, update, delete, and view tasks, with support for marking tasks as "todo", "in-progress", or "done". The data is stored in a JSON file, which keeps track of tasks and their respective status.

* List tasks: View all tasks or filter tasks by status (done, pending, in-progress).

* Help: View available commands and usage.

* No external dependencies are required for this script.


## Usage/Examples
You can interact with this script using different commands. Below are the available commands and their usage.
### Commands
* add: Add a new task to the to-do list.
```bash
python task.py add --task "Task description"
```
* update: Update the description of an existing task by specifying the task number and the new description.
```bash

```
* delete: Delete a task by specifying the task number.
```bash

```
* delete_by_id: Delete a task by its unique ID.
```bash
python task.py delete_by_id --id TASK_ID
```
* mark: Mark a task as "todo", "in_progress", or "done" by specifying the task number and the desired status.
```bash
python task.py mark --number TASK_NUMBER --status STATUS
```
* list_done: List all tasks with the status "done".
```bash
python task.py list_done
```


* list_pending: List all tasks that are not marked as "done".

```bash
python task.py list_pending
```
* list_in_progress: List all tasks with the status "in_progress".

## How It Works

* The script reads from and writes to a task.json file.
* Each task is stored as a dictionary with the following fields:
  * id: A unique identifier for the task (UUID).
  * description: The description of the task.
  * status: The current status of the task (e.g., "todo", "in_progress", "done").
  * createdAt: Timestamp when the task was created.
  * updatedAt: Timestamp when the task was last updated.

## Example
```bash
python task.py add --task "Complete homework"
python task.py list
python task.py mark --number 1 --status "in_progress"
python task.py list_in_progress
python task.py update --number 1 --task "Complete homework and submit"
python task.py delete --number 1
```
